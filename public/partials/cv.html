		<h1>Curriculum vitae</h1>

		<p>My name is <b>Joakim Gunst</b> and I'm a user experience designer and software engineer with a passion for designing and developing products that are great for the customer – both valuable and easy to use. I believe that software is primarily a tool for solving people's real-world problems, and that the best way to do this is to combine technical expertise with an iterative process and a user-focused mindset.</p>

			<p>
				I have been working full time as a UX designer since I graduated in 2012.
				My work consists of both interaction design and web front-end development in about equal parts.
				As an <b>interaction designer</b>, I create mockups and prototypes and support product management in researching and writing user stories for new functionality. 
				I have arranged dozens of user interviews and usability tests to learn about user needs and test my designs.
				I have also done some amount of visual design, although this is not my speciality.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As a <b>front-end developer</b>, I am very comfortable with  HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming.
				I have been partly or fully responsible for the front end in several web applications, using frameworks such as Angular and Bootstrap to create modern, responsive single-page applications.
				Working as part of a Scrum team, I am very familiar with practices like version control, refactoring, unit testing, code reviews and agile planning.
				Our back-end technology is primarily Microsoft ASP.NET, so I am also somewhat familiar with .NET and C# programming.
