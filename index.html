		<h1>Joakim Gunst</h1>
		
		<p>I'm a user experience designer and software engineer with a passion for designing and developing products that are great for the customer – both valuable and easy to use. I believe that software is primarily a tool for solving people's real-world problems, and that the best way to do this is to combine technical expertise with an iterative process and a user-focused mindset.</p>

			<p>I design and prototype products before and during development – working with product management, users, developers and other stakeholders to produce and refine designs that satisfy the needs of the different groups. I also do web front-end development as part of an agile team.</p>
