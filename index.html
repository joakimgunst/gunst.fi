			<h1>Joakim Gunst</h1>
			
			<p>I'm a user experience designer and software engineer with a passion for designing and developing products that are great for the customer – both valuable and easy to use. I believe that software is primarily a tool for solving people's real-world problems, and that the best way to do this is to combine technical expertise with an iterative process and a user-focused mindset.</p>
